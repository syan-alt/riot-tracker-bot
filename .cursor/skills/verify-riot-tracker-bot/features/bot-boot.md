# Bot boot

Starts the live Discord bot process and confirms the gateway connects. Uses only the bot token — no user login.

## Sub-features

- `boot` — process starts without crash
- `commands` — slash commands register (including dev commands when `DEV_MODE=true`)
- `gateway` — Discord gateway reaches ready state

## How to get to it (user POV)

Run `pnpm start` with `DEV_MODE=true` and an isolated `DB_PATH`.

## Driving it with pnpm verify

Preconditions: Node 24, ambient `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`.

- Action: run `pnpm verify` or start `pnpm start` manually.
- Observable: log contains `slash commands registered` with `devMode: true` and `discord gateway ready`.

## Gotchas

- Node 22 crashes on `@effect/sql-sqlite-node` import; use Node 24.
- `pnpm dev` needs a `.env` file; cloud agents use `pnpm start` with ambient env.
