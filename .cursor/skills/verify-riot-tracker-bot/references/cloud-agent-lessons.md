# Cloud agent lessons

Lessons from running `pnpm verify` on Cursor Cloud against Railway production.

## Railway tokens on Cursor Cloud

`RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` is often a project or workspace UUID, not a personal account token.

- `railway whoami`, `railway list`, and `railway link` return `Unauthorized` (`me` is not allowed). That is not a dead end.
- GraphQL `projects` and `railway ssh` still work once project, service, and environment are named.

Discover IDs:

```bash
pnpm exec railway api 'query { projects { edges { node { id name } } } }'
```

Production in this repo has been:

- project name `riot-tracker-bot`
- service name `riot-tracker-bot`
- environment name `production`

Export before ssh (names or ids):

```bash
export RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID=<project-id>
export RAILWAY_SERVICE=riot-tracker-bot
export RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

The CLI reads `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`. Cursor Cloud may inject `RAILWAY_API_KEY` or `RAILWAY_TOKEN`; `src/verify/production-riot-id.ts` copies those onto `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`.

## SSH

`railway ssh` needs a key Railway knows and a host key in `known_hosts`:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
pnpm exec railway ssh keys add -k ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub -n cursor-cloud-verify
ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 ssh.railway.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
pnpm exec railway ssh --service riot-tracker-bot -- pnpm admin status --json
```

Banners go to stderr. JSON is on stdout; slice from the first `{`.

Do not set `VERIFY_RIOT_ID` when ssh works. The harness picks the first production account that already has tracked games.

## Bot boot race

dfx can emit READY before `makeDiscord` subscribes. `src/services/discord/index.ts` subscribes to READY before rank-emoji and command REST.

`pnpm verify` treats the process as up when it sees `discord gateway ready`, or both `slash commands registered` and `application started`. READY often arrives a moment later. Do not fail the run only because READY was late.

## Valorant Henrik 404

A 404 whose body asks the player to finish a game is a missing game, not a harness failure. League can still be in `games` / `tracked`. Second refresh must have `added: []`.

## Project tokens and GraphQL

`RAILWAY_API_TOKEN_PROD` / `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN_DEV` are project tokens. The CLI sends them as `Authorization: Bearer`, which makes `whoami`, `ssh keys add`, and `projects` fail.

The same token works as header `project-access-token` against `https://backboard.railway.com/graphql/v2`. That can list variables, services, and volumes.

`railway ssh keys add` is unauthorized for project tokens, and `railway volume files` uses SSH, so sqlite on `/data` cannot be copied this way. Match fixtures are dumped with `scripts/dump-production-matches.py` (Discord notification-channel riot ids, then Riot/Henrik). Do not print variable values.

## Cloud runtime

- Node 24. Node 22 crashes on the sqlite native import.
- `pnpm start` with ambient env. `pnpm dev` wants a `.env` file that does not exist here.
- Leave the verify bot running. The harness deletes only its isolated sqlite file.
